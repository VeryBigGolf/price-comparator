# 🛒 Shopping Value Comparator

👉 **Live Demo:** [verybiggolf.github.io/price-comparator](https://verybiggolf.github.io/price-comparator/)

A simple web app to compare merchandise values and find the lowest price per unit. Just input the product name, price, quantity, and size—it automatically calculates and highlights the best deal.

**Why I built this:**
I got annoyed standing in the toothpaste aisle trying to calculate which one was actually cheaper using a normal calculator app. It was a hassle, so I built this tool to solve that problem instantly.
