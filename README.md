`A simple web app to compare merchandise values and find the lowest price per unit. Just input the product name, price, quantity, and size. It will automatically calculate and highlight the best deal.`

**Why I built this:**
`I got annoyed when I was buying toothpaste and trying to calculate which one was actually cheaper using a normal calculator app. It was a hassle, so I built this tool to solve that problem instantly.`

Built with a lot of help from Gemini.
